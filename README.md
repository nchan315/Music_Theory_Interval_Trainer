# My Personal Project Proposal

## Music Theory Interval Training Application

I want to build an application to help music students learn how to
identify and write intervals. This project is of interest to me 
because I teach piano as a part-time job. There have been times 
when I have thought that it would be nice if my students could
have an opportunity to practice more intervals outside of lesson
time in a fun and engaging way. I want my application to be able
to test:

- identifying intervals (minor 2, major 2, etc...)
- naming the next note given the bottom note and interval
- listening and identifying intervals

This would be beneficial to my music students because practicing
intervals helps with note reading and music theory.

## User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to:

 - create a custom playlist of intervals I want to work on
 - identify intervals given two notes
 - name the next note given the bottom note and interval
 - keep track of how many intervals I have gotten correct
 - keep track of which intervals I tend to get wrong
