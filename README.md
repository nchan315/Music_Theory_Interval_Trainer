# My Personal Project Proposal

## RCM Ear Training Software

I want to build an application to help music students with
their ear training. This project is of interest to me because
I teach piano and help violin students with their ear 
training as a part-time job. There have been times when I 
have thought that it would be nice if my students could
have an opportunity to practice ear training outside of
lesson time. Some ear training exercises can easily be 
automated, such as :

- identifying intervals (minor 2, major 2, etc...)
- identifying chords (major triad, minor triad, etc...)
- identifying cadences (perfect, imperfect, etc...)

This would be beneficial to my music students because
practicing ear training outside of lesson would give more time
to the ear training that need feedback, such as rhythm 
clapback and melody playback.

## User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to:

 - keep track of how many intervals I have gotten correct
 - keep track of which intervals I tend to get wrong
 - create a custom playlist of intervals I want to work on
 - replay intervals until I understand what the interval should sound like

Although all the user stories have used intervals as an example,
I want these functionalities to apply to all ear training exercises.
